# Logiquest: Teaching Programming Skills with Natural Language

### Winner of ICHack24 Creative Arts Category.

Learning to code can be incredibly frustrating, especially when first making the jump from natural language, where meaning is often inferred from context, to writing lines of code, which must always be precise.

We wanted to bridge that gap and make the transition easier, introducing algorithmic thinking via natural language. This led to Logiquest, a classroom-based tool to do just that in an intuitive, visually appealing manner.

## Natural Language Instructions
Students are presented with grid-based levels. The goal is to move their pointer from the initial position to the goal. To accomplish this, they provide instructions in natural language to an AI marker, which parses this input and validates it against the current level.

## Tailoring the Classroom Experience
To provide end-to-end capability for customising learning, teachers are able to create their own levels. To focus on a particular topic or form of solution (e.g. use of loops or if-statements), they are also able to provide instructions to the AI marker.

Students are then able to tackle the teacher's custom levels, and the AI marker will mark as incorrect any technically valid solutions which violate the teacher-provided guidance.
